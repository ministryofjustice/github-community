## 🏗️ github-community Repository

The **github-community repository** serves as the primary hub and a single pane of glass for all things **GitHub Community**. To help engineers quickly build and deploy their projects, this repository hosts a **modular monolithic Flask application**. Engineers can optionally choose to host their ideas here, minimizing maintenance burdens while gaining quick access to shared components.

### 🔑 Key Features

- **Single Flask Application:** A shared core framework hosting multiple projects.
- **Single Set of Dependencies:** Simplified dependency management.
- **Shared Database (Amazon RDS - PostgreSQL):** Minimal maintenance with easy access to data persistence.
- **Shared Authentication:** Quickly secure projects with a common authentication layer.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Projects are self-contained within the monolith.
